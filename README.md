The user can enter a string, choose their hashing algorithm and it will immediately give them the hash. It supports all common hash function such as MD5, SHA-1SHA-224 and one of the most popular ones: (sha256) without any configuration.

Features

X Supports Multiple Hash Algorithms: MD5, SHA1, SHA224,SHA256,SHA384 and.sha512.

Input Validation: Warns the user if no input string were provided

Example
Input String: password

Selected Algorithm: sha256

Generated Hash: 5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d4b9d5c72d4e7f3f60b2c7b62
